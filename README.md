### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

The biggest challenge in this assignment was understanding the Swift language. Tim, the instructor did a great job of taking us through step-by-step what the   application development process would look like. However, in order to be able to continue on by myself, I need to understand Swift at a deeper level. So, topics like Optionals and Casting are a couple I need to spend some personal time in understanding.
