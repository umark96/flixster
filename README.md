### Notes
For Part 2, I was able to understand a lot more of how Swift works and Xcode as well simply through my own research and having the ability to revisit what was done in Part 1 last week. One of the biggest challenge I faced this week was keeping track of all my views and where everything aligned properly. There were a couple of instances where I was trying to connect a Collection View in the wrong swift file. I noticed that as more was being added to the app, it was getting more complicated to keep track of all the views. With more practice and understanding of the common errors, it will likely get easier!

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

The biggest challenge in this assignment was understanding the Swift language. Tim, the instructor did a great job of taking us through step-by-step what the   application development process would look like. However, in order to be able to continue on by myself, I need to understand Swift at a deeper level. So, topics like Optionals and Casting are a couple I need to spend some personal time in understanding.
